# Execution Layer Nodes

Wrapper nodes for pre-trade checks, order sizing, execution, fill ingestion,
portfolio updates, risk controls and timing gates. These classes bridge
strategy signals with exchange node sets described in
[exchange_node_sets.md](exchange_node_sets.md) and rely on helper modules
under `qmtl/sdk`.
