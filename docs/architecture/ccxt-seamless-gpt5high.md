# CCXT × Seamless Provider Design (GPT5-High, Archived)

> **Status:** This document has been superseded by the consolidated [CCXT × Seamless Integrated Architecture (High + Codex)](ccxt-seamless-integrated.md). All runtime guidance, diagrams, and recipes from the GPT5-High draft now live in the integrated blueprint.

The original content has been merged into the integrated specification to avoid drift between documents. See the integrated file for:

- Data plane coverage math, SLA budgets, and backfill coordination details.
- Redis and process-level rate limiting guidance.
- Provider code recipes and operational runbooks.
- Future roadmap extensions (ccxt.pro live feed, synthetic series, trades→bars repair).

This stub remains so historical links continue to function. Please update bookmarks and navigation entries to the integrated document.
