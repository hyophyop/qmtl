# Release 0.1 Definition of Done (DoD)

This document defines the conditions that must be met to mark QMTL Release 0.1 as “done.” A release is complete only when every requirement below is satisfied.

## Scope

### Included

- Core Loop automation and the primary execution flow (Submit → Evaluate/Activate → Execution/Gating → Observe)
- Basic startup and health checks for Gateway/WorldService/DAG Manager
- A fixed set of local/CI verification commands
- Minimum release artifacts

### Excluded

- Performance validation of strategy (alpha) logic
- Long-term operations tuning (stability/scale)
- New external broker or data provider integrations

## Required CLI/Endpoint Surface

### CLI

The commands below are required surfaces for Release 0.1, and each must be runnable at least once.

- Config validation: `uv run qmtl config validate --config <path-to-config> --offline`
- Start Gateway: `qmtl service gateway --config <path-to-config>`
- Start DAG Manager: `qmtl service dagmanager server --config <path-to-config>`
- Run sample strategy (online): `python -m qmtl.examples.general_strategy --gateway-url http://localhost:8000 --world-id demo`

See the [Backend Quickstart](backend_quickstart.md) for the full startup sequence.

### Endpoints

- Gateway status: `GET /status`
- DAG Manager health (root stack): `GET /health`

## Required Tests/Verification Commands (Local/CI Parity)

Release 0.1 verification must be runnable locally using the same command set as CI.

```bash
uv run --with mypy -m mypy
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run python scripts/check_design_drift.py
uv run python scripts/lint_dsn_keys.py
uv run --with grimp python scripts/check_import_cycles.py --baseline scripts/import_cycles_baseline.json
uv run --with grimp python scripts/check_sdk_layers.py
uv run python scripts/check_docs_links.py
bash scripts/package_smoke.sh
uv run -m pytest --collect-only -q
PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 uv run --with pytest-timeout -m pytest -q --timeout=60 --timeout-method=thread --maxfail=1 -k 'not slow'
PYTHONPATH=qmtl/proto uv run pytest -p no:unraisableexception -W error -q tests
USE_INPROC_WS_STACK=1 WS_MODE=service uv run -m pytest -q tests/e2e/world_smoke -q
CORE_LOOP_STACK_MODE=inproc uv run -m pytest -q tests/e2e/core_loop -q
```

Core Loop contract tests are anchored to the architecture summary and the test skeleton.

- [Core Loop summary](../architecture/architecture.md#core-loop-summary)
- Test skeleton: `tests/e2e/core_loop/README.md`

## Minimum Release Artifacts

- `CHANGELOG.md` updated for Release 0.1
- Documentation build success: `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
- Python package outputs:
  - wheel generated by `uv pip wheel .` (or `uv build --wheel`)
  - sdist generated by `python -m build` or equivalent
- Packaging artifact install smoke (minimum `qmtl --help`) must be reproducible via `scripts/package_smoke.sh`
- Release documentation archiving confirmed in the [Release Process](release.md)

## Release Notes Verification Evidence

- Add the DoD verification evidence link to the GitHub Release notes.
  - CI run URL or execution logs/artifact location link
- The release notes must include the `CHANGELOG.md` summary and the evidence link above.

## Rationale

- The Core Loop summary and contract tests define the Release 0.1 stability baseline.
- Operational startup follows the Backend Quickstart with a minimum configuration.
