# Strategy Development and Testing Workflow

> **Practical development guide and checklist**
>
> - **Separation of concerns (SoC)**: keep modules single‑responsibility; depend on interfaces. See [architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).
> - **Test independence**: avoid inter‑test coupling; use clear assertions and messages.
> - **Coding rules**: modularize code, split functions, and document with comments/docstrings.
> - **Troubleshooting**: for install/run/connectivity issues, see [FAQ](../reference/faq.md) and the "Common issues" section below.
> - **Operations/deploy**: before deployment, verify tests, backup configs, define rollback, and configure monitoring. See [monitoring](../operations/monitoring.md) and [canary rollout](../operations/canary_rollout.md).
> - **Folder/file quick reference**:
>   - `strategy.py`: entry point; Strategy implementation
>   - `qmtl.yml`: environment/services config
>   - `generators/`, `indicators/`, `transforms/`: custom node implementations
>   - `tests/`: unit and integration tests

This guide walks through the typical steps for creating and validating a new QMTL
strategy. It starts with installing the SDK and project initialization and
concludes with running the test suite.

## 0. Install QMTL

Create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode. The
[docs home](../index.md) describes the details, but the basic steps are:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

## 1. Initialize a Project

Create a dedicated directory for your strategy and generate the scaffold. List
available templates, then initialize the project with a chosen template and
optional sample data:

```bash
qmtl project init --list-templates
qmtl project init --path my_qmtl_project --strategy branching --with-sample-data
cd my_qmtl_project
```

The command copies a sample `strategy.py`, a `qmtl.yml` configuration and empty
packages for `generators`, `indicators` and `transforms`. These folders let you
extend the SDK by adding custom nodes.


## 2. Explore the Scaffold

- `strategy.py` – a minimal example strategy using the SDK.
- `qmtl.yml` – sample configuration for the Gateway and DAG Manager.
- `generators/`, `indicators/`, `transforms/` – extension packages where you can
  implement additional nodes.

> **Structure note:** See the above checklist for folder/file roles.

Run the default strategy to verify that everything works. Offline mode is used
when no external services are configured:

```bash
python strategy.py
```
The scaffolded script uses `Runner.offline()` by default, so no external
services are required. To connect to your environment, update the script to call
`Runner.run(world_id=..., gateway_url=...)`, which follows WorldService decisions
and activation events.

The Gateway proxies the WorldService, and SDKs receive control events over the tokenized WebSocket returned by `/events/subscribe`. Activation and queue updates arrive through this opaque control stream instead of being read directly from Gateway state.

## 2a. Example Run Output

The following snippet demonstrates the results of executing the above commands in a clean
container. After creating the scaffold the directory structure looks like:

```text
$ ls -R my_qmtl_project | head
my_qmtl_project:
generators
indicators
qmtl.yml
strategy.py
transforms
...
```

If the script calls `Runner.run(...)` without a reachable Gateway/WorldService,
the strategy will remain in a safe compute‑only state (order gates OFF) until
the control connection is restored.

> **Common issues**
> - Missing Gateway URL: add `--gateway-url` or use `Runner.offline()`
> - Dependency conflicts: reinstall via `uv pip install -e .[dev]`

## 3. Develop Your Strategy

Edit `strategy.py` or create new modules inside the extension packages. Each
strategy subclasses `Strategy` and defines a `setup()` method that wires up
`Node` instances. Useful base classes include `StreamInput`, `TagQueryNode` and
`ProcessingNode`. See [docs/sdk_tutorial.md](sdk_tutorial.md) for a full
introduction to these concepts.

Configuration options such as connection strings live in `qmtl.yml`. The file is
ready for local development but can be adjusted to point at production services.

> **Development guidelines**
> - Keep each node single‑responsibility and interact via interfaces.
> - Split complex logic into functions/classes and document with docstrings.
> - Update relevant docs and tests alongside code changes.

## 4. Execute with Worlds

Use `Runner.offline()` for local testing without dependencies. For integrated runs,
switch to `Runner.run(strategy_cls, world_id=..., gateway_url=...)`. Activation and queue
updates are delivered via the Gateway's opaque control stream on the `/events/subscribe`
WebSocket; WS remains the authority for policy and activation.

Execution domains are now surfaced explicitly on envelopes:

- WorldService decisions emit `effective_mode` (`validate|compute-only|paper|live`).
- Gateway/SDKs derive `execution_domain` (`backtest|dryrun|live|shadow`) using the normative mapping `validate → backtest (orders gated OFF)`, `compute-only → backtest`, `paper → dryrun`, `live → live`.
- Example: [`dryrun_live_switch_strategy.py`]({{ code_url('qmtl/examples/strategies/dryrun_live_switch_strategy.py') }}) toggles between `dryrun` and `live` by reading `connectors.execution_domain`. Legacy `trade_mode=paper` values are coerced to `dryrun` for compatibility.
- Offline runs mirror the `backtest` domain, so a `validate` decision never publishes orders until promotion completes.

```bash
# start with built-in defaults
qmtl service gateway
qmtl service dagmanager server

# or load a custom configuration
qmtl service gateway --config qmtl/examples/qmtl.yml
qmtl service dagmanager server --config qmtl/examples/qmtl.yml
```

Multiple strategies can be executed in parallel by launching separate processes
or using the `parallel_strategies_example.py` script.

> **Tip:** In production, back up `qmtl.yml` and prepare a rollback plan.

## 5. Test Your Implementation

Always run the unit tests in parallel before committing code:

```bash
uv run -m pytest -W error -n auto
```

A sample execution inside the container finished successfully:

```text
======================= 260 passed, 1 skipped in 47.15s ========================
```

End‑to‑end tests require Docker. Start the stack and execute the tests:

```bash
docker compose -f tests/docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d
uv run -m pytest -n auto tests/e2e
```

For details on the test environment refer to
[docs/operations/e2e_testing.md](../operations/e2e_testing.md). Building wheels can run concurrently with
tests if desired:

```bash
# Example of running wheels and tests in parallel
uv pip wheel . &
uv run -m pytest -W error -n auto
wait

### Test Teardown and Shutdown

When a test starts background services (e.g., TagQueryManager subscriptions or ActivationManager), prefer the session context manager to ensure everything is cleaned up:

```python
async with Runner.session(MyStrategy, world_id="w", gateway_url="http://gw") as strategy:
    ...  # assertions
```

If you cannot use ``async with`` (e.g., in synchronous tests), fall back to the explicit helpers:

```python
strategy = Runner.run(MyStrategy, world_id="w", gateway_url="http://gw")
try:
    ...  # assertions
finally:
    Runner.shutdown(strategy)
```

The helpers are idempotent and safe to call even if no background services are active.

### Test Mode Budgets

Enable `test.test_mode` in `qmtl.yml` to apply conservative client-side time budgets that reduce the chance of hangs in flaky environments:

- HTTP clients: short polling intervals and explicit health checks
- WebSocket client: shorter receive timeout and overall max runtime (≈5s)

```yaml
test:
  test_mode: true
```
```

> **Test authoring tips**
> - Keep tests independent; avoid cross‑test dependencies.
> - Use clear assertion messages to diagnose failures quickly.
> - Define coverage targets and test critical logic.
> - Separate unit and integration tests.

## 6. Next Steps

Consult [architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md) for a deep dive into the overall
framework and `qmtl/examples/` for reference strategies. When ready, deploy the
Gateway and DAG Manager using your customized `qmtl.yml`.
