# World Design Review and Refinements (Research Summary)

This note critically reviews the initial research draft for Worlds and
consolidates actionable refinements across semantics, policy DSL, transition
safety, risk budgeting, shared resources, observability, and work items.

## 1) Fit and Gaps

What works
- QMTL already supports PaperTrading ↔ Brokerage switching, Runner orchestration,
  performance metrics (Sharpe, MDD), and Prometheus integration, so a
  “validate → promote” pipeline integrates naturally.
- Binding policy/resources/observability at world boundaries is appropriate.

Gaps
1. Time/data semantics
   - Define data currency explicitly (now − data_end tolerance) to prevent
     look‑ahead/survivorship bias on backfill catch‑up.
2. Sample sufficiency/statistical validity
   - Add minimum sample days, trade counts, confidence thresholds, and
     guardrails to mitigate overfitting.
3. Transition atomicity/safety
   - Enforce 2‑phase semantics (drain, idempotency, rollback, double‑order
     prevention) for dry‑run → live.
4. Portfolio/risk budgets
   - Pairwise correlation alone is insufficient. Add VAR/gross/net/sector caps,
     leverage bounds, and circuit breakers.
5. Multi‑world and shared nodes
   - If introducing shared nodes, enforce strict boundaries (hash namespaces),
     and drain safely during pruning.
6. Observability and governance
   - Standardize audit logs, version rollback, SLOs, and alert rules.

## 2) Refined Design (Highlights)

A. Data Currency Gate
- `max_lag`, `min_history`, `bar_alignment`, per‑metric warmup.
- Decide initial phase by comparing `now - data_end` with `max_lag`.

B. Policy DSL: Gate + Score + Constraint + Hysteresis
- Gates: thresholds and sufficiency.
- Score: bounded expressions.
- Constraints: correlation/exposure, sector caps, leverage.
- Hysteresis: promote/demote after K passes, min dwell.

Example
```yaml
selection:
  gates:
    and: [sharpe_mid >= 0.60, trades_60d >= 40, max_dd_120d <= 0.25, sample_days >= 30]
  score: "sharpe_mid + 0.1*winrate_long - 0.2*ulcer_mid"
  topk: { total: 8, by_side: { long: 5, short: 3 } }
  correlation: { max_pairwise: 0.8 }
  exposure:
    gross_budget: { long: 0.60, short: 0.40 }
    max_leverage: 3.0
```

## 3) Work Items (Condensed)

- Domain/store: world/policy schemas; audit/decision logs.
- Policy/eval: DSL parser + validator; sufficiency and currency gates; evaluator.
- Execution/transition: `OrderGateNode`; 2‑phase applier; position policies.
- Multi‑world/resources: SILO by default; shared nodes optional with namespaces.
- Observability: SLOs and alerts for promotion/demotion/failure/latency.
- CLI/API: evaluation/apply endpoints and world‑scoped RBAC.

## 4) Parameter Separation

- Side‑specific budgets and Top‑K (e.g., `gross_budget: { long: 60%, short: 40% }`).
- Manage StrategyInstance(params) per world/side for clarity and auditability.

## 5) Expected Outcomes

- Positive: policy/resource/observability separation; measurable, auditable
  promotions; safe automation.
- Neutral: complexity increases with shared nodes—mitigate via staged adoption.
- Negative: without drain/hysteresis/risk cuts, toggling and unintended orders
  may occur—default policies should remain conservative.
