I’ve loaded the scoped issues and verified the repo. I’ll start with DAG schema idempotency and index improvements, then audit the ProcessingNode input change.

Plan updated: implement Neo4j schema/CLI/docs, validate tests; then check ProcessingNode input changes.

What I changed

- qmtl/dagmanager/neo4j_init.py: Expanded schema and added rollback helpers
  - Added indexes to meet query p95 targets and keep init re-runnable:
    - CREATE CONSTRAINT compute_pk IF NOT EXISTS ON (c:ComputeNode) ASSERT c.node_id IS UNIQUE
    - CREATE INDEX kafka_topic IF NOT EXISTS FOR (q:Queue) ON (q.topic)
    - CREATE INDEX compute_tags IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:ComputeNode) ON (c.tags)
    - CREATE INDEX queue_interval IF NOT EXISTS FOR (q:Queue) ON (q.interval)
    - CREATE INDEX compute_buffering_since IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:ComputeNode) ON (c.buffering_since)
  - Added drop/rollback utilities:
    - get_drop_queries(), rollback_schema(driver), rollback(uri, user, password)
- qmtl/dagmanager/cli.py: Added a rollback CLI subcommand
  - New subcommand: qmtl dagmanager neo4j-rollback with uri/user/password args.
- docs/architecture/dag-manager.md: Documented the new schema and idempotency
  - Extended “1.2 인덱스 & 제약 조건” with new indexes and a short note and examples showing:
    - neo4j-init is idempotent
    - a matching neo4j-rollback path for lower envs

Issue-by-issue

- 755: [DAG Manager] Neo4j schema migrations and idempotency
  - Summary: Production-grade constraints/indexes; idempotent init; add rollback path and docs.
  - Changes:
    - Added targeted indexes for hot paths:
      - Tag queries: compute_tags, queue_interval
      - Buffering/GC scans: compute_buffering_since
      - Kept existing compute_pk and kafka_topic with original order to preserve tests.
    - Added idempotent rollback (drop) helpers + CLI subcommand.
    - Documented commands and rationale in the DAG Manager architecture doc (no nav change required).
  - Acceptance:
    - qmtl dagmanager neo4j-init is re-runnable: All statements use IF NOT EXISTS.
    - Query p95 ≤ 50ms: The added indexes target the actual match conditions used by TagQuery and buffer scans. This minimizes label scans on c.tags membership and q.interval filters.
  - Files touched:
    - qmtl/dagmanager/neo4j_init.py: Add indexes; add rollback helpers.
    - qmtl/dagmanager/cli.py: Add neo4j-rollback.
    - docs/architecture/dag-manager.md: Describe schema + idempotent init/rollback.
- 756: [Runner] WS-only path resilience soak
  - Status: No changes in qmtl/ needed for acceptance as written; existing tests already exercise reconnection/timeout/ack paths. If you want policy doc additions, point me to target doc and I’ll add a short section.
- 757: [Nodes] ProcessingNode.input spec change (dict removed)
  - Findings:
    - Enforcement exists: qmtl/sdk/node_validation.py raises TypeError for Mapping inputs; Node docstring states dictionaries are no longer supported.
    - Tests assert this: tests/test_node_inputs.py and tests/test_multi_input_node.py expect TypeError for dict input.
    - Docs/examples align; tutorial explicitly says dict input is no longer supported; examples use list inputs.
  - Status: Done; no changes required.
- 758: [TagQuery] Centralization and Runner integration
  - Findings:
    - TagQueryNode resolution and Runner/TagQuery integration already exist and are tested in tests/gateway/test_tag_query.py.
    - Cache/normalization logic lives in SDK and gateway; behavior appears consistent across realtime/backtest in current tests.
  - Status: No code change needed for qmtl/ at this time. If you want clarifying docs on refresh cadence/timeouts, I can add them to docs/guides or operations with your preferred location.
- 759: [SDK] Strategy submission API and scaffolding sync
  - Status: Out of scope for minimal qmtl/ changes without touching templates/strategies; requires end-to-end examples and likely cross-tree changes. Recommend a separate issue or expanding acceptance criteria under qmtl/.
- 760: [Observability] dagmanager-metrics standardization and alert rules
  - Findings:
    - Metrics already exposed with consistent names (diff_duration_ms_p95, queue_lag_seconds, orphan_queue_total, etc.) in qmtl/dagmanager/metrics.py.
    - Alert rules exist (alert_rules.yml). If needed, I can add a short checklist under docs/operations/monitoring.md to make the triad (latency/failure-rate/throughput) explicit.
  - Status: Likely complete; doc polish optional.

Validation

- Preflight hang scan:
  - Command: PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 uv run --with pytest-timeout -m pytest -q -k 'not slow' --timeout=60 --timeout-method=thread --maxfail=1
  - Result: 650 passed, 4 skipped, ~50s
- Full tests:
  - Parallel auto: uv run -m pytest -W error -n auto
  - Result: 2 flaky failures surfaced (unraisable resource warnings aggregation and a Kafka consumer monkeypatch race); re-running targets individually passed. These failures are unrelated to the DAG schema change.
  - Mitigation: Running serial (-n 0) yields 1 intermittent unraisable warnings failure in tests/e2e/test_world_isolation.py. This appears to be a pre-existing flake from websockets cleanup/resource warnings under -W error, not caused by this change.
  - Recommendation: For CI stability, consider capping workers or marking the specific test to ignore resource warnings; alternatively, add ResourceWarning filtering for those tests. I did not change unrelated tests per repo guidelines.
- Docs build:
  - Command: uv run mkdocs build
  - Result: Success, no warnings.

Suggested commit message

- For 755 (auto-close):
  - Fixes #755: Neo4j schema idempotency + performance indexes; add rollback CLI and docs
- For 757/758/760 (no code changes):
  - Refs #757, Refs #758, Refs #760: Verified current enforcement, integration, and metrics; no qmtl changes required

Next steps

- Do you want me to add a short TagQuery refresh cadence/timeout section to docs (issue 758)?
- If you want a formal “migrations” doc page, I can add docs/operations/neo4j_migrations.md and link from mkdocs.yml.
- I can open a follow-up PR/issue to deflake the resource warnings tests by adding per-test warning filters or ensuring event loop/WS cleanup in those tests.
