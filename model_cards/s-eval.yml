strategy_id: s-eval
model_card_version: v1.0
objective: Demo model card linking evaluation runs to strategy metadata
data_overview:
  - Synthetic returns from SDK validation fixtures
  - 1h bar data with limited coverage for smoke tests
key_assumptions:
  - Momentum signal remains stable across the evaluated horizon
  - Liquidity is sufficient for simulated position sizes
key_limitations:
  - No live execution evidence; backtest metrics only
  - Risk calibration is not production-grade
